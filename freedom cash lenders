Borrowing limit maxes out at $4,000: Some other lenders offer personal loans up to $1,000 or even more, but Discover sets a relatively low borrowing limit.
No opportunities for interest rate discounts: While some lenders offer a rate cut to existing customers or borrowers who opt in to automatic payments, Discover doesn’t offer rate discounts. 
No option to add collateral or co-signer to loan: Discover personal loans are unsecured, so you alone must meet underwriting requirements for credit and income to qualify. There’s no option to add a co-signer or apply for a joint personal loan.
